# robofriends
This simple React app demonstrates filtered searching and JSON parsing. <br><br>
The names of each Robot are fetched from jsonplaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and the assigned cartoon images are auto-generated using the robot's ID number and robohash (https://robohash.org/${id}?200x200) <br><br>
Stateful components are updated to display robots that dynamically match the user's search queries. <br><br>
